# Json-Lint

Originally made so that sensitive JSON files belonging to the company could be reformatted and validated without using external online JSON Linters.

# How to Use?
Pretty simple to figure out how to use the Linter.
1. Copy and paste your JSON.
2. Click on Reformat if you need to create proper indentations
3. Click on Validate. If its <font color="green">Green</font>, you are good to go!
4. Click on Copy to copy your validated, reformatted JSON and Clear to clear the box.
5. Repeat!

**Pro-tip: You should ideally point an Nginx or Apache at the index.html file and give it a domain name for internal company usage - eg: jsonlinter[.]xyzcompany[.]com**
